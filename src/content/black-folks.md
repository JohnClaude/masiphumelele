There is an unmatched resilience that rests in the belly of townships. The resilience I am talking about is sourced from the reserves of the overpopulated and service-depleted ghettos. Where most beautifully bronze folks fear vast bodies of water because they think they cannot swim despite the fact that their realities force them to swim each and every day.
<br><br>

If your world gives you the ultimatum to either swim or peril, best believe that if you want to see another day, you will be as agile as a fish even though you have never floated a day in your life.
<br><br>

Who can possibly swim if they cannot swim? Or swim without floating? Or perhaps, swim whilst weighed down by the gravity of suffering spilling over from past lifetimes? Who can laugh and jive jovially despite the savage whipping of poverty? Or share a smile that warms up the house of their white madam despite the indignity of their wages?
<br><br>

The answer is black South Africans. Black, peri-urban, poor South Africans who are duped into normalising the brutality of inequality they are subject to whilst being gaslit and guilt-tripped into “getting over it”.
<br><br>

Imagine if those words were uttered to a holocaust survivor or a Rwandan…Are they so casually thrown around here because apartheid is a lesser crime against humanity?
<br><br>

I’ll let you think about that.
