In Masiphumelele we have many local businesses such as barber shops, cosmetics stores, spaza shops, and shops that sell fast foods and street food. These businesses make our lives easier because now you can shop near you and that means you donâ€™t need money for taxi fare to travel to the mall to do your shopping. 
<br><br>

As local buyers we also benefit by saving money because the prices for food are low and they also sell fresh food. This is what attracts people about our local businesses in Masiphumelele.
<br><br>

 The point of these businesses is to make money, feed their families and to build a legacy for their kids. They want to chase poverty back to where it comes from!
