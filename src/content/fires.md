Masiphumelele is renowned for tragic fires that claim homes year in and year out. If we were to ask the City of Cape Town for an audit on the funds spent on reactionary disaster-funds: plaster measures to shake a few families into shacks, to await the next winter’s fire—it would be clear that it makes absolutely no sense to not invest in a long-term housing plan, one that puts the dignity of Masiphumelele residents at the heart of a solution to prevent future fires.

What breaks my heart is the frequency of these fires. They are so frequent, often times affecting vast areas of land, and the same area of wetlands that I am left haunted by the question: who can build a home (with appliance we all require for comfort: a fridge, TV, beds, cupboards, plates and cups, clothes) if devastating fires are two-plate stove away? How can folks living on such scarce wages be expected to buy these essentials every couple of years because the City refuses to give Masiphumelele more land to accommodate for its burgeoning population?

Spatial apartheid is rife in this part of the deep south. It’s as calculated as Israel’s settlement policy that has wiped out most of what is historic Palestine. Masiphumelele has become land-locked between thriving suburbs, a mere minute away by car and a few minutes by walking. Land that was promised my people got sold for private housing developments, just across the road from our taxi rank. These “estates”/settlements spring up all around us—gated, safe, serviced, with no bursting pipes or anorexic streets that leave people, cars and kids competing for space to simply move.

Masiphumelele stares right into Capri Village, yet people there can breathe whilst we are left suffocating, choking on the multiplicity of our man-made poverty. Segregation is noticeable even in the trees if you pay attention. Whilst “suburbs” are beautified with a diversity of trees that nudge one to relax and (exhale) breath, our people are shaded with scarce, towering alien-species. I guess it’s a subliminal message to remind us township folks that we are and will forever be aliens in our own birthland.

So what if we burn year in year out? We are aliens, aren’t we?
