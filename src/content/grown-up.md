I had to be a grown up at an early age. Mama is a drunkard; all she does is drink and goes to sleep in her shack that looks like it has been there for more than a decade. It has holes in it and when it rains heavily the house becomes an ocean with the bed floating like a boat on top of the water. The next morning when she wakes up she shouts at us like dogs, she looks even more scary when she is angry and roaring like a lion. Her wrinkled face that looks like ripped granadilla skin, her hair is stiff and stubborn. Her clothes are ripped and full of holes, they are super dirty. She shouts at us every chance she gets especially when she doesn’t have money to buy beer, she takes out her frustration on us. <br><br>

We have no one else to turn to, but I, Lesedi, as the older brother, I do have hope in myself. I do have faith. I do see the light approaching me and my two little brothers, Lethabo and Litha. I love these young ones to death, even though they can be troublesome at times but I would kill and even die for them. They are all I could ever ask for. Though we are deep in the pool of poverty, we never go to bed hungry. As the older one I always make ends meet. As small as I appear to be, I am strong. I was born poor but my mind is not at all poor. I am down to earth and I am always motivated by the older guys from eKasi who have made it, like Siya Kolisi--the rugby super star. I admire this guy. I always read books about him and how he grew up. I guess his childhood is almost like mine. <br><br>

Majority of the people in my neighbourhood are very fond of me, I guess it's because of my positive attitude and my behaviour. They always compliment me saying I am different and respectful unlike my mother. I always help out and get the little I can to provide for Litha and Lethabo, because mama is hardly at home and the cupboards are always dry and empty, there is never any food. I know the streets, because I am always out there hustling if I am not at school. I’d say I was once tempted to be part of the gangsters to make more money for my family, but ultimately, I decided against it.
Despite everything that happens I’ve decided to never lose hope. I know me and my brothers will make it in life. The thought of me not being loved or taken care of by my own mother does affect me very much… But what can I say? I guess it’s part of life and I have to be strong for my two brothers. They are the only reason I always have the energy to wake up every day and live! I live for them. For them, I had to be a grown-up at an early age.
