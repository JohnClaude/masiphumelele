“When did we arrive here? Was it 93 or 94?” The two women quiz each other trying to remember the exact year of their arrival to this place. Their names are Nomsingatho Philda Ngwenduna and Nokuthula Elsie Nomadwayi and they are some of the first people who moved into Site Number 5 or Site 5, as Masiphumelele was initially called. Before winning the court battle for this land, our founding mothers and fathers fought against the apartheid government that tried to displace them twice under the 1963 Group Areas Act.

When Nomadwayi arrived in Cape Town she lived with her white employers in Capri. “We heard there were people living in the forests so on weekends, we would go and stay with those people”. By forests, she refers to Greenpoint, a farmland property that is nestled near Noordhoek’s sports field. This plot was owned by a white farmer who lived between Eldon and Grabouw who leased his land to Africans during the 70s and 80s. Some of the people who formed part of this tight knit community had relocated from larger townships such as Crossroads, whilst others were fresh from the Transkei. Nomadwayi and Ngwenduna were amongst those on this plot. They called this place Greenpoint, a name they still refer to till today. Greenpoint is now known as Lake Michelle, an up-market, wealthy and mostly white, gated estate.

Living in Greenpoint without drinking water meant the community had to buy water from the nearby petrol station or carry containers home from their employers’. Most dwellers purchased their groceries from Kwa Louw, a small Afrikaans owned spaza shop. After some time living in Greenpoint, this community was moved, but luckily, just across the road to Dozenberg, land that was owned by DC De Villiers, a Simonstown mayor at the time. Dozenberg is located at the belly of Ou Kaapse Weg Drive, and like Greenpoint, it has transformed into a multi-million-rand residence known as Chapman's Bay estate.<br><br>
