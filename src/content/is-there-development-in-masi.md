Personally, I believe Masi is still developing, but on the other side it’s not. We have youth programs teaching us about teen pregnancies, preventions and so forth, but our mothers aren’t fully taught about such things.

Parents do not understand teenagers and the worst part is when they don’t believe us. Parents need mentors to teach them about the problems we as the youth face. They aren’t always sensitive to our challenges because they don’t have enough knowledge sometimes. Our parents still believe that when a child does something wrong you must hit them and that your neighbour is also your mom and dad. They don’t understand that things have changed and that we are facing rape cases where a child is raped by their own father or neighbour. The world we live in is much crueller, so they need to start adapting into our ‘world’ I’d say. As black people we need black psychologists who will understand us.
