In this picture I see a few businesses; people are trying to make a life. I see foreign women selling veggies and next to them is a small catering restaurant. It looks like it’s a sunny day and it’s a little bit in the afternoon (Kuyarhatyela). The reason ndisithi kuyarhatyela zizithunzi[^1] zi everywhere and everything I see on the picture isithunzi[^2]. The sky is clear and blue with a little bit of clouds. I also see a caravan that is not moving. There is a small spaza shop and a lady has just come out of it at. She is standing on the left side of the picture. There’s a shack upstairs which is well made and looking strong.<br><br>

When I look at the picture, I feel good because the people make their own money and aba bantu[^3] are not from here in SA cause you can see la restaurant ibhalwe[^4] “Mama African Food” kanti ukuba ibiyom[^5] Xhosa or someone walapha[^6] e-SA ibizabhalwa[^7] “Sis Ntosh Takeaways” or anything but yona[^8] its indicating ukuba[^9] it’s from the other parts of Africa.
Xa ndijonga[^10] ipicture it looks smooth and the first place my eyes are drawn to the women and the restaurant sign. Xa uzama ujonga ubuso babantu ababonakali[^11]  coz baze ngamacala[^12]. <br><br><br><br>
