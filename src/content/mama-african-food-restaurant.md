In this picture I see a few businesses; people are trying to make a life. I see foreign women selling veggies and next to them is a small catering restaurant. It looks like it’s a sunny day and it’s a little bit in the afternoon (Kuyarhatyela). The reason ndisithi kuyarhatyela zizithunzi<sup>1</sup> zi everywhere and everything I see on the picture isithunzi<sup>2</sup>. The sky is clear and blue with a little bit of clouds. I also see a caravan that is not moving. There is a small spaza shop and a lady has just come out of it at. She is standing on the left side of the picture. There’s a shack upstairs which is well made and looking strong.<br><br>

When I look at the picture, I feel good because the people make their own money and aba bantu<sup>3</sup> are not from here in SA cause you can see la restaurant ibhalwe<sup>4</sup> “Mama African Food” kanti ukuba ibiyom<sup>5</sup> Xhosa or someone walapha<sup>6</sup> e-SA ibizabhalwa<sup>7</sup> “Sis Ntosh Takeaways” or anything but yona<sup>8</sup> its indicating ukuba<sup>9</sup> it’s from the other parts of Africa.
Xa ndijonga<sup>10</sup> ipicture it looks smooth and the first place my eyes are drawn to the women and the restaurant sign. Xa uzama ujonga ubuso babantu ababonakali<sup>11</sup>  coz baze ngamacala<sup>12</sup>. <br><br><br><br>

- <sup>1</sup> I say it is getting late is because clouds are everywhere
- <sup>2</sup> shadows
- <sup>3</sup> These people
- <sup>4</sup> Is written
- <sup>5</sup> But if it belonged to…
- <sup>6</sup> From here in South Africa
- <sup>7</sup> It would be written
- <sup>8</sup> It
- <sup>9</sup> that
- <sup>10</sup> When I see
- <sup>11</sup> When you try to look at their faces you can’t see them.
- <sup>12</sup> They’re standing sideways.
