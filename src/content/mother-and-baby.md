In the background is an old lady selling chicken feet. Children are coming back from school and there is a woman carrying a baby on her back passing by, waving at the person taking the photo. She is smiling. The baby on her back doesnâ€™t look as happy as the mother under the blazing, hot sun. The light of the sun makes this picture warm and more interesting as it tells a story. In my view, the story is about a woman living in an informal settlement that is poverty stricken. She smiles when she sees the white photographer, regardless of her situation because at least, her humanity is seen.
