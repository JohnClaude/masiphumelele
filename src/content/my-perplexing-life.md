I had to grow fast <br>
It was a must <br>
I had to man up at an early age <br>
I had to be involved in crime for them <br>
I waited and waited but no one came to help me with them <br><br>

I cried and prayed <br>
Every second, every minute <br>
Every hour, every day and every month <br>
Hoping the Lord will answer. <br><br>

I had to kill to survive <br>
I had to commit murder in this worked up world <br>
I had to pray just so I could have something to hold onto <br>
I had to cry for the pain to go away <br>
I had to keep quiet just for people not to judge me <br>
My heart is hurting and no one cares. <br><br>

All I do Is kill, kill, kill. <br>
All I do is hurt people <br>
Iâ€™m tired.
