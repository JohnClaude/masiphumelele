I used to think of you <br>
You were the only hope I had <br>
You were the only who understood me <br>
You were the only one who knew how to <br>
Heal me <br>
I cry everyday hoping you will come <br>
Back to me <br>
I look at you whenever I see you <br>
Hoping you will notice and<br>
Come back To me <br>
You said you love me <br>
You lied <br>
You said you’d die for me <br>
You lied <br>
You said you’ll be with me forever <br>
You lied. <br><br>

Cold nights are passing, you aint here <br>
Lonely nights are passing, you aint here <br>
But you said you are my pillar and strength <br>
Maybe I was wrong about you <br>
You aint what I thought you were <br>
AND please don’t bother coming back to me<br>
You failed.
