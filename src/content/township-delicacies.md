In Masiphumelele, we have people who sell different types of food. Zimbabweans love to eat a spinach called rap and covo and tiny fish called matemba. We also have businesses alongside the road where people sell all types of foods, vegetables, and exotic fruits like coconuts.

Our township delicacies can be either braaied , fried or cooked. With braaied food you can get amanqina, inyama ye hagu, inyama ye nkomo, intloko ye nkukhu,and a smiley. Also food cooked on a metal basin on a fire include amathumbu and amagila.
