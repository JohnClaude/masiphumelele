“A school of choice committed to excellence” <br><br>

Ukhanyo Primary School was founded in 1993, by Mrs Nikiwe Ndyalivane, a Masiphumelele resident and teacher, who served as the school’s first principal. Originally built to accommodate 668 children, Ukhanyo started off with a few humble bungalow buildings erected on bare sand with no playground in sight. Almost thirty years later, this school has successfully transformed itself beyond recognition of its early days.<br><br>

As the only government school located in the community, Ukhanyo Primary services just over 1900 learners, majority of whom live in Masi, whilst others travel in from Red Hill and Capricorn. The school has a strong team of 52 teachers who are supported by a network of community members employed as sports coaches, security guards, and cooks that prepare food for the school’s feeding scheme. <br><br>

Ukhanyo Primary School has benefited immeasurably from the leadership of its Principal, Mr Michael Thyali. Mr Thyali joined Ukhanyo Primary School on 7th July 2000, employed initially as Deputy Principal. By 2005 he was elected as the primary school’s principal, a role he has successfully steered for the past sixteen years. Under his guidance, Ukhanyo has gone from strength to strength, growing in facilities and breaking stereotypes. Mr Thyali has effectively negotiated partnerships with local NGOs whose programmes have worked to nurture and empower the school’s learners both educationally and recreationally. <br><br>

Ukhanyo Primary School currently runs four exceptional educational facilities, including its very own computer lab. Through partnership and support from Masicorp, a Masiphumelele-focused NGO that provides community and educational upliftment programmes, Ukhanyo runs an English Lab, Mathematics lab and Science lab where educators provide additional academic support in these subjects. The school also has a debating club, life skills programme and after-school art classes run by Lalela, an award-winning art programme that provides free art lessons to a number of disadvantaged communities across South Africa. <br><br>

Ukhanyo also boasts of its top-tier sporting facilities, with a state-of-the-art AstroTurf soccer pitch, netball court and cricket bowling nets, funded by Mr Vince van der Buy, a renowned South African retired professional cricketer and teacher. Other sporting facilities were also established through the support and partnerships with MCC Masi 750 which continue to support sports activities in the community. <br><br>

“Ukhanyo is a unique school, and our teachers are committed to a common vision of excellence” stated Principal Thyali when asked what he loves most about the school. “We work as a team and we are all enthusiastic about what we do… I grant my staff space to grow, to make mistakes and to learn from them”. And when asked what he hopes for the school in the future, the principle confidently stated: <br><br>

<q>Ukhanyo (“light” in isXhosa) is exactly what Ukhanyo Primary brings to our community. The school brings a hope that permeates past its classrooms and radiates from the children’s happy smiles, noticeable in their confident strides. Buzzing like bees in their black and yellow school tracksuit, laughing happily and playing as they walk home. I hear them, we all do.</q> <br><br>
