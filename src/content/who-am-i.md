My name is Lindokuhle and my surname is Manana. I was born on the 22nd of December 2006, in East London. I have both parents and two younger brothers. I’m the first born. I was living in the Eastern Cape in iDutywa from when I was young until I was 5 years old, then I moved to Cape Town. I started school in Ukhanyo Primary School in 2012 from grade R until grade 7 in 2019. I started High School in Simon’s Town. My favourite subject in primary was Mathematics. I even got 3 schorlaships because I got 92% in Mathematics in Grade 7. <br><br>

I grew up in Masiphumelele. Many things happened but I’m thankful because I’m still safe. I’d say I’m not a person that can easily be influenced. I’m very quiet and shy. I don’t know but I don't like to be around many people, I get bored easily and I can’t pretend. I’m very sensitive, little things hurt me. In primary, learners at my school used to insult me about my teeth and my hair. When I grew up I didn’t love myself. I didn’t have confidence and I blamed the people who used to insult me as I would always look at myself in a mirror and I didn’t feel good about myself. I’ve accepted myself and how my teeth are now.<br><br>

I’ve taught myself to accept how I look. I should not be what people want me to be. I should not sacrifice things that matter to me just to impress people. People will always talk about whether you are doing good or not. Love yourself and appreciate how you look.
